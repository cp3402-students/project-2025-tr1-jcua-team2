# Site documentation

## Adding dot points for current changes made and can expand on these as we finalise the site

### Home Page
* Use posts to add articles to the home page
* Use the 'home-page-post' category to display on the home page
* Maximum of 9 articles can be displayed on the home page
* Articles will stack on top of each other on smaller devices such as phones and tablets rather than being 3 columns wide
* Articles display a shortened length of their content on the home page to ensure consistency. The post can be opened and viewed to reveal the whole article
* Scrolling hero page is currently set in the index.php
* Scrolling hero images are stored in the theme in the directory /assets/images/
* Hero image links look for the pages/posts with the name "about" or "registration" respectively 
    * If these end up named different, will need to ensure the php file is updated accordingly
